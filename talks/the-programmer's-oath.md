### The programmers' oath

In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers, I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:

为了捍卫计算机编程师的职业荣誉，对着我的能力与认知的最高水准，我发誓：

I will not produce harmful code.

我将永不生产有害代码

The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

由我生产的代码将始终是我最呕心的作品，决不容忍有缺陷的代码有行为性或结构性积累

I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

对于每次发布，我将提供一个快速、明确、可重复验证的方法，以证明我的每一段代码均按照设计运行

I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

我将坚持多次而少量的更新发布原则，以不阻塞同事的进度。

I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

我将抓住每次机会，勇敢而持续地提高我的创造力，决不辜负上苍赋予

I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

我将尽力提高自己抑或他人的生产力，反之断不可

I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

我将一以惯之地确信，他人可替代我的岗位，而我亦可替代他人的岗位

I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

我将从广度与深度，诚实地评估，决不于模糊不定时给出承诺

I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

我将永不停息地学习并提高我的技能
